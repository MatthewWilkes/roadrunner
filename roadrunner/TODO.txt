- Find a way to potentially reload all dependencies. Perhaps we could create
  process snapshots at various points along the initialization process and then
  use the most relevant one to build on top of.
  
- We could fork at various points in the init process.  Each fork could be
registered by name so we could resume from any particular point we want using
a simple API to script the children.

For example you could store one fork for just before the Plone core init but after the main Zope init.

something like: 

process.restore('zope:after', next_action='plone')

- integrate a way to reload the modules.  if its a Zope module we need to be able to re-init.  how does Zope's reload module do it?
